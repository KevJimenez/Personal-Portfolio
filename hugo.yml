      I am an aspiring IT professional particularly in the field of System Administration, Cloud, and DevOps. My professional background is mostly on the field of Real Estate and Aviation, but I do tinker with technology a lot as a hobby. Made projects that can showcase my skills and abilities in SysAd, Cloud, and DevOps. Since I was tinkering with tech at a very young age, I can describe myself as tech savvy and can easily learn and understand complex technological software and terms.
